In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

## made with:

- react
- typescript
- css

## time:

- 2-3 hrs making it ( a little over, sorry )
- 2 hrs+ playing with and exploring new features that didn't get used (css modules/ animated elements/ etc)
- 30min readme, pushing, sending, etc

## if i had more time:

- finished the pannel on the right
- fix the kebab menu so it doesn't stay when not focused on
- better responsivness (css media queries)
- and more ... I'll tell you about it at the next stage of the interview process ;)

## pleased with:

- map the elements to create the badges, makes the site very flexible for future

## Git stuff:

- no branches used as it was a short, 1 person project not getting deployed
- a few commits in the history to check out
